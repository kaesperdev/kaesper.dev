        Simply put, I was looking for something that would meet these criteria:
      </h2>
      <ul class='mt-4 list-disc pl-10 text-xl md:text-2xl'>
        <li>Relate to me in some way</li>
        <li>Easy to remember & pronounce</li>
        <li>Unique enough to not be taken on my most used platforms</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class='mt-8 text-2xl font-normal md:mt-10 md:text-3xl'>
        A longer explanation on how I came up with it:
      </h2>
      <h3 class='mt-4 text-xl md:text-2xl'>
        The username itself comes from the phonetic transcription of the word
        Casper (ËˆkÃ¦spÉ™r), which is the anglicized form of my actual first name
        (Kacper). It's also a reference to the ghost from the movie of the same
        name, which I've always found to be quite funny.
